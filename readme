The challenge here was to extract meaningful data from Sybase sp_sysmon
reports.  I was also challenged to provide the output in Excel format.

So this suite of tools will dump out the values I have interest in from 
sp_sysmon, into CDL files.  These are imported with a VBA macro, and formatted.

With this data, significant improvements to Sybase performance were easy
to plan.
